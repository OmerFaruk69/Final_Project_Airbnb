# Introduction {.smaller}

Here is the introduction tab for our Shiny app. You can see a little description and the three different cities you can explore in this app, displayed on a world map.

# Compare two or more cities 
In this tab, you will be able to compare features from cities. The feature selection is made on the side panel.  
First, you have to select two or more cities to compare.   
Secondly, select the feature you're interested in : revenue, price or availability over the 30 last days.   
Then, choose a plotting type: you can plot an histogram, a density plot or a boxplot. You can also compare the average.   
Finally, you have the possibility to add another feature to compare.

In this example, you can compare the **average price** of Airbnb listings in the three cities : **San Diego, Amsterdam** and **Berlin**.

# Deep dive into one city 
In this tab, you will be able to deep dive into one city and display its features.  
This tab allows you also to show a map of the city you're interested in and to show any feature you want.

## Example 
*Density plot example with one city, one features*     
![Screen taken on the app](screen5.jpg){ width=75% }   
Here is displayed an example of **density plot** to compare the **availability over the last 30 days** proposed in **San Diego**.  

## Example 
*Boxplot example with one city, two features*  
![Screen taken on the app](screen6.jpg){ width=75% }  
Here is displayed an example of **boxplot** to compare the **revenue over the last 30 days** based on the number of **bedrooms** proposed in **Amsterdam**.

## Example 
This tab also allows you to display data on a map.   
![Screen taken on the app](screen7.jpg){ width=60% }  
Here are the listings of **Berlin**, clustered in the neighborhoods of the city.  
Zooming in, you can see the feature you want to see. Here, you can observe the **room type** of a particular Airbnb location.
